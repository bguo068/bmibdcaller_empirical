# Goal

Based on the clean data prepared in the `input` folder, prepare dataset subsets
of around a size of 1000, one subset of single-population, one subset of a
population with structure.

# Steps

1. Further clean up the data by removing highly-related samples
    - based on IBD inferred via hap-ibd as it very fast
2. In the remaining dataset 
    - Regional dataset
        - ESEA
        - WAF
    - Contential dataset 
        - WSEA
        - ESEA
        - WAF
        - EAF
        - SAM
